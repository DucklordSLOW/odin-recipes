    <h1>Chili Dog Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/chili-dog-mac.webp" width="400" height="400">
    <p>I'm not too sure why I am putting this recipe on here. I looked it up online and it sounded like something I would like to make and try. Maybe I will make it one day. It has tought me that our home recipes lack the instructions of one you find online.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 generous tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano, preferrably Mexican oregano</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green peppers</li>
        <li>1 lb hot dogs, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (28 oz) can crused tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 rounded cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>8 oz shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 oz shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>green onnions, sliced, for the top (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
        <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
