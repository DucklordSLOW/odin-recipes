        <p>A bolognese is a tradition meat sauce from northern Italy. It differs from the sauces in souther Italy in that it does not use tomatoes or dried pasta.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>1 cup  minced onion</li>

            <li>1 cup minced celery</li>
            <li>2 lbs minced meat (your choice - I go with equal parts ground pork and beef)</li>
            <li>1 oz dried porcini</li>
            <li>6 oz tomatoe past</li>
            <li>1 cup stock</li>

            <li>pasta (preferrably homemade)</li>
            <li>cheese for garnis</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rehydrate porcini per package instructions.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in large dutch oven. Add sofrito (minced onion, carrot and celery) and cook 5 - 8 minutes until sofrito is sweating but not browned.</li>
            <li>Add chopped porcini and tomatoe paste. Cook 3-4 minutes until paste turns the color of brick.</li>
            <li>Add meat and lightly brown.</li>
            <li>Add red wine.  Simmer until mostly evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add stock and milk.  Simmer over low heat covered until desired consistency.  Most likely 2 - 3 hours.  Optionally add a bay leaf during this step.</li>
